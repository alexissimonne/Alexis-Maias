      <h3>Static</h3>
        <p>This is a photo edited on Illustrator to appear as a glitch. This was a photo I had taken of a rocket and the moon in the distance. It reminds me of an old school television.</p>

      <h3>Emotions</h3>
        <p>This composite photo represents everything I am feeling on the inside as a young mother. The chaos, love, hurt, and confusing I have experienced throught my life has its own little part in this photo. The whole entire object together is supposed to be the shape of a woman holding a baby(the white area). The white area(baby) represents the "light of my life". In the background, you can see the still clam lake which represents the way I carry myself on the outside.</p>

      <h3>The Walk</h3>
        <p>In this sound art project, I was trying to capture the normal walk from class to my car. If you listen closely, there is a humming sound which gets a higher pitch and lower pitch as the walk continues. This is just to signify the different thoughts going in and out of my head. As I get into the car and turn it on, music plays to signify other thoughts to come on the drive home.</p>

        <p>This is just a glimpse on what I have been working on the most in the last year. I shoot on film for fun and for myself.</p>

      <h3>A Mood</h3>
        <p>This Video Art project was mainly about different aesthetic feelings someone might be going through. Again, thoughts going through someones head many "play again" and people retrace their steps or actions or a certain scenario and overall change moods. More of an aesthetic to listen to. </p>

      <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>In this interactive website I wanted to bring together hot and cold. This website seems like it could be something interesting for children. It is very simple and to the point. All of the images were vectorized in illustrator while the main page was drawn in illustrator as well.</p>

      <h3>In the Jungle</h3>
        <p>This video art project is shot in San Francisco with background noise coming from a tropical jungle. This is to give a sense that the city is like a "jungle". Different background music also plays to show the different culture of people or different genres. I like creating a space where you can use your imagination while looking at something you have seen before; try to look in a different perspective.</p>

      <h3>Ex</h3>
        <p>This is what it sounds like when a recent ex wants to talk to you while sitting by a beautiful pond. Enjoy.</p>
